    Create a list of questions and answers from the following conversation.
    Give a mix of who, what, when, where, why, and how questions as applicable.
    Include names in the question if needed rather than using pronouns.
    Include some that are exactly specific, like "what show did Richard watch last week?", 
    and others that are more open-ended, like "what are some things I've done recently?"
    and "what shows have I discussed with Richard?"
    Relative terms like "last year" or "last month" can be used, but should be in reference to the last date in the data,
    {date}.
    DO NOT USE DATES OR DATETIMES IN THE QUESTION.

    Here are good example questions:

    "question": "When is Bentley's Belated Birthday party?",
    "answer": "On the 23rd",

    "question": "Did Nahum ever start reading Golden Kamuy in January?"
    "answer": "No"

    "question": "What was Kastenâ€™s game plan in December last year?"
    "answer": "nap until 8pm
            get up and go to the roof
            ?????
            profit"

    "question": "What are some of Richard's

    Here are bad examples:

    "question": "What happened on 11/23/2024?"
    "answer": "Bentley's Belated Birthday party"

    bad: uses a date in the question
