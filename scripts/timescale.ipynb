I can understand that wrt job hunting, college applications, course work which goes at break neck speed, cooking, etc. but there are things that you can control, and things that are beyond your control.  Please make a short list of what you have to do to finish the undergrad program. And don't be under too much pressure to make a cutting edge contribution for your undergrad thesis/capstone. I think you are doing great under the circumstances and are much more knowledgeable than I was when I was your age. Plus, I think you have put your best efforts in preparing for your college applications both in breadth and depth.\n",

Here would be my thoughts about the list: - If you can, please make sure that the paper gets accepted. - Wrt job hunting, the best use of the time would be to collaborate with your batchmates (and seniors that you can get in touch with) for preparing and getting a chance to interview (extremely hard these days but still worth pushing...). - Please send an email to Deepa's friend that had gotten you the possibility of an internship in Europe.

You should tell us about your background, motivating influences for studying statistics, and your career goals and objectives. If you are currently enrolled in a graduate program elsewhere, you should tell us why you wish to change institutions or degree programs.\n",

(Implicitly mentioned) Take care of himself and manage stress: Papa expressed concern about Krishna being under stress and suggested that he make a short list of things he has to do to finish his undergrad program, implying that he should prioritize self-care and not put too much pressure on himself.\n"
