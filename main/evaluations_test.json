    "reasoning": "The model's response is mostly accurate. It correctly identified 'Portage Bay' as the restaurant being discussed, which aligns with the ground-truth. Additionally, the model mentioned 'somewhere in the U district' which is also supported by the context. The mention of them agreeing to meet at 2 PM slightly deviates from the ground truth about the reservation at 1:15, but this detail does not significantly affect the answer's correctness regarding the restaurant discussed.",

    "reasoning": "The model's response does not match the ground-truth answer at all. The model incorrectly identified the restaurants being considered as \"Burger Hut\" or \"a new Indian place,\" while the ground-truth states that the group discussed going to Portage Bay. The discrepancy between the model's response and the true answer is quite significant, leading to a score of 1.",
